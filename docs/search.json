    "text": "🎯 The Vision Behind World Expo 2025\n\nThe World Expo is an incredible opportunity to meet people from all over the globe. It brings together countries and cultures, celebrating innovation and without regard to age, gender, or status.Since the first World Expo in 1851, many impressive changes have taken place around the world.\nThis year’s theme is “Designing Future Society for Our Lives,” with three sub-themes: “Saving Lives,” “Empowering Lives,” and “Connecting Lives.” As this is just a short post, I won’t be able to cover all of the sub-topics in detail. That’s why I chose to focus on “The Future of Community and Mobility.”\n\nSmart cities\ndisaster prevention and reconstruction\nmetaverse\nspace\nrobots\nEV/FCV\nflying cars\ncyber security\n\n\nTechnology promises efficiency. Nature thrives on resilience. What if we stopped treating these as opposites?\nIn this essay, I explore what happens when we apply ecological thinking to artificial intelligence — and why it might be the mindset shift we need in the face of climate breakdown."

I’ve worked across the humanitarian world, startup ecosystems, and the corporate universe — always looking for the sweet spot where curiosity, empathy, and impact meet.\nI hope you enjoy poking around here.

**Hi, I'm Anna** ðŸ‘‹

\
I started this blog out of curiosity â€” to explore how climate, AI, society and tech intersect, and to share content that can raise awareness, spark action, or question the status quo.

Iâ€™m a human-centered communicator and strategy nerd with a background in international relations, linguistics, and data-driven innovation. Iâ€™ve worked across the humanitarian world, startup ecosystems, and the corporate universe â€” always looking for the sweet spot where curiosity, empathy, and impact meet.

I hope you enjoy poking around here. Have fun â€” and if something sparks your mind, letâ€™s connect ðŸš€

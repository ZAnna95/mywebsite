## 🎯 The Vision Behind World Expo 2025 {style="color: black"}

::: {style="color: grey"}
The World Expo is an incredible opportunity to meet people from all over the globe. It brings together countries and cultures, celebrating innovation and without regard to age, gender, or status.Since the first World Expo in 1851, many impressive changes have taken place around the world.

This year's theme is *"Designing Future Society for Our Lives,"* with three sub-themes: *"Saving Lives," "Empowering Lives,"* and *"Connecting Lives."* As this is just a short post, I won't be able to cover all of the sub-topics in detail. That’s why I chose to focus on *"The Future of Community and Mobility."*

-   Smart cities

-   disaster prevention and reconstruction

-   metaverse

-   space

-   robots
